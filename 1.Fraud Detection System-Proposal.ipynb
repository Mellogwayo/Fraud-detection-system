    "Fraud detection systems play a critical role in safeguarding financial transactions by accurately identifying fraudulent activities while minimizing false positives. This proposal aims to develop a fraud detection system using machine learning algorithms tailored to the specific challenges posed by credit card fraud. The primary objective is to achieve high accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions while maintaining a low false positive rate. The proposed system will utilize the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) as the key performance indicator (KPI), with a target AUPRC of 0.8 or higher. By leveraging a dataset of credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, this project seeks to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of fraud detection in the banking industry."

    "## Introduction:\n",
    "Fraudulent activities in financial transactions pose significant threats to both businesses and consumers. According to Provost et al. (2013), the 1990s saw a significant transformation in the banking and consumer credit industries due to automated decision-making. During this time, banks and telecommunications companies implemented massive-scale systems for managing data-driven fraud control decisions. This evolution underscores the importance of continuously adapting fraud detection systems to evolving fraud patterns and techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit card fraud, in particular, remains a prevalent issue, with fraudulent transactions leading to financial losses and erosion of trust. To address this challenge, the proposed fraud detection system aims to leverage machine learning techniques to accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. By enhancing the efficiency of fraud detection, businesses can mitigate financial risks and protect their customers from unauthorized charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background:\n",
    "The dataset used for this project is a Kaggle dataset on Credit Card Fraud Detection. It consists of credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. Over a two-day period, there were 492 fraudulent transactions out of a total of 284,807 transactions, representing only 0.172% of the total. The dataset's highly unbalanced nature presents challenges for traditional accuracy metrics, necessitating the use of the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset comprises solely numerical input variables resulting from a PCA transformation. Due to confidentiality constraints, the original features and additional background information about the data cannot be disclosed. Principal components V1 through V28 are derived from PCA, while the 'Time' and 'Amount' features have not undergone PCA transformation. The 'Time' feature indicates the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first one in the dataset, while 'Amount' represents the transaction amount. The 'Class' feature serves as the response variable, taking a value of 1 for fraud and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology:\n",
    "The methodology involves preprocessing the dataset, including handling missing values and scaling numerical features. Feature engineering techniques will be applied to extract relevant information and improve model performance. Various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, will be trained and evaluated using cross-validation. Hyperparameter tuning will be performed to optimize model performance, with a focus on achieving the target AUPRC of 0.8 or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope and Limitations:\n",
    "The scope of this project is limited to developing and evaluating a fraud detection system using a specific dataset of credit card transactions. The findings and recommendations may not be generalizable to other domains or datasets. Additionally, due to data confidentiality constraints, the original features and background information about the data cannot be disclosed, limiting the interpretability of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis Plan:\n",
    "Given the imbalance in class distribution, assessing accuracy using the AUPRC is advisable. This evaluation metric aligns with the project's aims, which are to enhance the model's ability to detect fraudulent transactions accurately and reduce instances of false positives. The AUPRC provides a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance in capturing true positives while considering the precision-recall trade-off. Balancing these metrics is essential, and specific targets have been set: an AUPRC of 0.8 or higher, a precision of at least 0.8, a recall of 0.7, and a maximum acceptable false positive rate of 0.1%.\n",
    "\n",
    "By setting these targets, the project aims to strike a balance between minimizing false positives and maximizing the capture of true positives, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of fraud detection in the banking industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources Required:\n",
    "- Dataset of credit card transactions\n",
    "- Python programming language\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook for data analysis\n",
    "- Scikit-learn library for machine learning algorithms\n",
    "- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes:\n",
    "The expected outcomes of this project include the development of a fraud detection system capable of accurately identifying fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. By achieving the target AUPRC of 0.8 or higher, the proposed system aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of fraud detection in the banking industry. The insights and recommendations derived from this project will contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat financial fraud and protect consumers' interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "In conclusion, the proposed fraud detection system represents a proactive approach to addressing the challenges posed by credit card fraud. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and advanced evaluation metrics, the system aims to improve the accuracy and reliability of fraud detection while minimizing inconvenience to legitimate users. Through collaborative efforts and continuous refinement, we can strengthen the resilience of financial systems and safeguard the interests of stakeholders.\n",
